# v1.4.0 - July 22, 2022
- turning off fraction unique flanking sequence filter by default
- include breakpoint and cigar alignment in duplicate read alignment definition
- under evidence read elimination: changing min read seq entropy to 0.75 from 1.5
- gzip chimJ outputs

# v1.3.0 - June 13, 2022
- improved sensitivity and overall accuracy for virus integrations, allowing for multimapping reads.
- using STAR single-pass mode
- uses nr virus db, no repeat masking within virus db
- masking K113 in human genome in 2nd phase search.
- maxhits = 50
- virus integrations organized according to virus breakpoint coordinates.
- human genome insertions organized according to flanking sequence similarity
- low complexity insertion flank sequences filtered to further exclude likely false positives


# v1.1.0 - Feb 22, 2022
- incorporated read cleaning step between STAR phases 1 & 2 involving trimmomatic and polyA-stripper. Can disable with --no_clean_reads parameter or using the wdl clean_reads boolean setting.
- splicing info added to report to indicate canonical splicing types
- breakpoint flanking sequences including candidate dinucleotide splice pairs are provided in output.
- final (refined) report restricted to those prelim entries that had non-zero recovered evidence reads.
- virus aligned bams are now restricted to proper pairs for PE reads.
- virus genome coverage content restricted to ungapped regions
- many revisions to Terra wdls to account for SE reads compatibility
- mitochondrial containing chimeric reads are auto filtered


# v1.0.1 - Dec 19, 2021
Largely redesigned for further improved accuracy and general utility.

# v0.1.0 - Mar 10, 2021
- initial public release

# v0.0.4 - Jan 14, 2021
- added LRsplice functionality

# v0.0.3 - Oct 26 2020
-included --star_init_only parameter for quick sample processing
