# v1.1.0 - Feb 22, 2022
- incorporated read cleaning step between STAR phases 1 & 2 involving trimmomatic and polyA-stripper. Can disable with --no_clean_reads parameter or using the wdl clean_reads boolean setting.
- splicing info added to report to indicate canonical splicing types
- breakpoint flanking sequences including candidate dinucleotide splice pairs are provided in output.
- final (refined) report restricted to those prelim entries that had non-zero recovered evidence reads.
- virus aligned bams are now restricted to proper pairs for PE reads.
- virus genome coverage content restricted to ungapped regions
- many revisions to Terra wdls to account for SE reads compatibility
- mitochondrial containing chimeric reads are auto filtered
